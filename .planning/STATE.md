## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- AGIdentity wraps OpenClaw (not plugin) - full control over auth
- MessageBox as primary channel - P2P encrypted with BRC-100 identity
- MPC for AI wallet - prevents key exfiltration
- MPC for CA - no single-party trust

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- MPC wallet implementation is external (interface only in this project)
- OpenClaw Gateway WebSocket protocol needs research in Phase 4
