# Roadmap: AGIdentity System Finalization

## Overview

Transform AGIdentity from a collection of components into a production-ready enterprise AI gateway. The system wraps OpenClaw with cryptographic identity, making every interaction authenticated, encrypted end-to-end via MessageBox, and signed by an MPC-protected AI wallet.

## Domain Expertise
